- room directory, a plan for cities / categories
    goal: create a specialized city room association and browse list. any room can be associated with
            a city, and when a user browses to that city it will show up (if public). If there is only
            one, attempt to auto join that room which will be the original city room. This will be the
            extent of special browsing features. The rest of discovery process is a random popular 
            room list and search.
